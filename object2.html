                <p>Anna Baker from Altoona, Pennsylvania one fell in love with an iron worker in 1849. However, this was to the displeasure of Anna’s father, Ellis Baker, who would not give consent for the two to marry. Ellis Baker was an ironmaster and using his immense power in the town, managed to have the young man banished from their town. </p>
                <p>
                    This caused anger and hatred from Anna to her father, causing her never to marry and eventually pass away in 1914. Anna had bought a wedding dress for her to get married before the young man was sent away. This, years later, was given to the Blair County Historical Society and later the Baker’s Museum.

                    This dress is on display in a glass case in Anna’s bedroom. This leading to the paranormal activity. Most commonly on full moons, the dress is reported to sway and move on its own as if Anna herself is wearing the dress. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This dress has moved so violently, the museum owners were worried the glass would break, it has also been known to cause people to hallucinate, seeing a woman dancing around the museum.
