                <p>The Hands Resist Him is a painting that was made by Bill Stoneham in 1972. This is of a 5-year-old boy and a female doll stood Infront of a glass door with many hands around them, as if reaching towards him. This was to symbolise the division of fantasy world and the real, waking world. However, it is what happened to the owner that is of our interest. </p>

                    This painting was placed on display in the Feingarten Gallery in Beverly Hills, California. Which led to it being reviewed by an art critic by the name of Henry Seldis and then bought by the actor John Marley. Within a few years the art critic, the gallery owner as well as John Marley were all dead. Leaving the painting to disappear.

                    This painting then resurfaced on an eBay posting in 2000, allegedly being sold because it was haunted. This painting terrified the child of the seller, who said that the boy and the doll would fight each other at night. Causing them to set up motion detecting cameras. This captured the boy leaving the painting and coming into the room where it was.
