                <p>James Byron Dean was a popular American actor, most well known for the film, Rebel Without Cause (1995) where he played Jim Stark. After his death in 1955 he received a posthumous Academy Award nomination for best actor. However, his death is what we shall focus on. </p>
                <p>
                    One week before his death, James Dean purchased a Porsche 550 Spyder and had it customised, with tartan seats, the number 130 printed on it and more. This was the car he named ‘Little Bastard’. He then showed his friend, Alec Guinness, who later wrote “The sports car looked sinister to me… I heard myself saying in a voice I could hardly recognise as my own: ‘Please never get in it…  if you get in that car you will be found dead in it by this time next week.’”
                </p>
                <p>
                    James shrugged this off, however he did not know that Alec would be correct. One-week later James was driving the car who swerved to avoid a car Infront of him, however they collided. James Dean was pronounced dead later that same day.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    The car was later purchased by George Barris who intended to make the car into a tourist spot to take pictures with, this car then slipped off the trailer and broke the leg of his mechanic. This led to him selling the car engine to Troy McHenry and William Eschrid who used the parts to build cars to race each other, Troy lost control and hit a tree, killing him instantly. Also affecting William, who’s car locked up, for no reason, rolling the car and seriously injuring him. Finally, 2 wheels were sold which then both exploded at the same time, causing the driver to run off the road.
