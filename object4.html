                <p>For someone who has written so many lovable children books, you would not expect one of them to be the most haunted book in existence. The foot book was first published in 1968 and conveys the opposites through different types of feet. This was also the first book that Dr. Seuss wrote after his wife’s death in 1967, which he made to distract himself. Spending full 8-hour days working on the book. </p>

                    One particular edition is within <a href="location1">West Virginia’s National Museum Of The Paranormal</a>, as it was given by a family that it had been terrorising. When this family would read the book, they would hear children whispering in the corners of their rooms. Apparently feeling like they were being watched. This book also contained a red stain on the front cover, so it was examined.

                <p>
                    The book belonged to a household that had a quadruple homicide inside of it, revealing the dark history behind the red stain on the book
