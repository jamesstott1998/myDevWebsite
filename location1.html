                <p>The National Museum of the Paranormal A.K.A the archive of the afterlife is one of the most haunted museums in the world. They try to entertain and educate people into the paranormal world of haunted relics, oddities, significant items and cursed artefacts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is led by passionate team members who commonly have connections with certain items inside the museum. Most items directly affect people looking at them, such as an artefact called Lydia who has made a lady grow very nauseous while looking at her, causing her to leave the establishment.
